          <h1>What is Hash and What does it do?</h1>
          <p class="intro">
            A hash is a fixed-length code generated from data of any size using a mathematical function. It acts 
            like a digital fingerprint, uniquely representing the input data. Hash functions are designed to be 
            fast to compute, produce consistent results for the same input, and be practically impossible to reverse. 
            They're used to verify data integrity, securely store passwords, and efficiently organize information 
            in databases. Even a tiny change in the input produces a significantly different hash, making 
            them useful for detecting alterations in data. Hashes play a crucial role in various cybersecurity 
            applications and data management techniques.
              <br>
            <h2>What is it's Role in Security?</h2>
          <p><u>Hashing plays a crucial role in security for several reasons:</u></p>
          
          <ul>
              <li><strong>Data Integrity:</strong> Hashes ensure data integrity by producing a unique fixed-size string (the hash value) from input data. Even a small change in the input data will produce a significantly different hash. This makes it easy to verify whether data has been altered.</li>
              <br>
              <li><strong>Password Storage:</strong> Storing passwords in plaintext is a significant security risk. Instead, passwords are hashed before being stored. When a user logs in, the entered password is hashed and compared to the stored hash. This way, even if the password database is compromised, the actual passwords remain secure.</li>
              <br>
              <li><strong>Digital Signatures and Certificates:</strong> Hashes are used in digital signatures to verify the authenticity and integrity of messages and documents. A digital signature is created by hashing the message and encrypting the hash with the sender’s private key. The recipient can decrypt the hash with the sender's public key and compare it with the hash of the received message to ensure it hasn’t been tampered with.</li>
              <br>
              <li><strong>Message Authentication Codes (MACs):</strong> Hashes are used in MACs to verify both the integrity and authenticity of a message. A MAC is created by hashing the message along with a secret key. The receiver, who knows the secret key, can perform the same hashing operation and verify that the message has not been altered.</li>
              <br>
              <li><strong>Data Deduplication:</strong> Hashes help in identifying duplicate data without comparing the actual data itself. This is useful in optimizing storage by eliminating redundant copies of data.</li>
              <br>
              <li><strong>Cryptographic Protocols:</strong> Hashes are integral to many cryptographic protocols, including SSL/TLS (for secure web communication), blockchain (for creating unique identifiers for blocks of transactions), and many others.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><u>Common Hash Functions:</u></p>
            <li>MD5: Widely used in the past but now considered insecure due to vulnerabilities.<br>
            <li>SHA-1: More secure than MD5 but also considered weak against certain attacks.<br>
            <li>SHA-256: Part of the SHA-2 family, currently one of the most secure and widely used hash functions.<br>
            <li>SHA-3: The latest member of the Secure Hash Algorithm family, designed to be highly secure.<br>
            <br>
            During my course, I implemented the SHA-512 hash function to create a secure login system for a hangman
             game I developed, providing an even higher level of security than SHA-256 (mentioned above) as it creates a 128 character hexadecimal string 
             instead of a smaller 64 char string. This essential layer of security protected access to my SQL database, which 
             I used for adding and removing new words to the game. 
             <br><br>As a passionate advocate for robust security practices, I chose SHA-256 because it's part of the SHA-2 family, known for its strong resistance to collision and
              preimage attacks. This level of security is crucial, even for seemingly simple applications like games, 
              because it helps safeguard user data and prevents unauthorized access to backend systems. 
              <br><br>By implementing SHA-256, I not only enhanced the security of my project but also gained valuable experience
               in cryptographic techniques that are widely used in industry-standard applications. 
               <br><br>In the following examples, I'll demonstrate how I implemented SHA-256 and created a custom library to 
               streamline its usage in my project:<br>

                <p class="paragraph">This script demonstrates the hashing of individual characters, adding an additional
                     layer of security to the hash process. When hashing, it's crucial not to re-hash already hashed
                      data, as it would complicate verification and increase computational overhead without enhancing
                       security. Instead, this script hashes each character of the input string independently.
                        <br><br>
                    First, the script initializes a function GetHash that utilizes the SHA-512 algorithm from Python's
                     hashlib library. This function encodes each input character into UTF-8 format, updates a hash object
                      with this encoding, and computes its hexadecimal representation.
                    <br><br>
                    To begin, the user is prompted to input text for hashing using a lambda function called getString, 
                    which defaults to "Hello, World!" if no input is provided. The script then iterates through each 
                    character in the entered text (stringToHash). For each character, it computes its hash using GetHash. 
                    If the computed hash is not already in hashDictionary, it stores this hash as a key with the character
                     as its corresponding value.
                     <br><br>                            
                     Finally, the script outputs the hashDictionary in a structured format, displaying each hash alongside
                     its corresponding character. Additionally, it saves hashDictionary to a file named <b>'hash_dictionary.txt'</b>. 
                     This file serves as a record for subsequent verification processes, ensuring the integrity and authenticity
                      of the original text through the unique hashes generated.</p>

                          <u>When I run this script, here's what happens:</u><br>
                          First, I'm reading in the <b>'hash_dictionary.txt'</b> file. This file contains all the hashes I created earlier, each linked to its original character. It's like I'm opening up my own personal codebook.<br>
                          Next, the script asks me to type in the text I want to verify. This should be the same text I used when I first created the hashes.<br>
                          <p></p>
                          As I enter each character, the script goes to work:<br>
                            <ul><li>It takes each character and creates a new hash for it, just like I did before.<br>
                            <li>Then it checks this new hash against my "codebook" (the hash dictionary).<br>
                            <li>If the hash matches and corresponds to the right character, I get a message saying that character is verified.<br>
                            <li>If something doesn't match up, I'll know right away because the script tells me that character failed verification.<br></li>
                          <p></p>
                            </ul>
                          I can see this process happening for each character I typed in. It's like watching a security check in real-time!
                          <p></p>
                          At the end, I get a final verdict:<br>
                            <ul><li>If every single character checked out okay, I see a message telling me everything was verified successfully.<br>
                            <li>But if even one character didn't match up, I'll know the verification failed.<br></li>
                          <p></p>
                            </ul>
                          This whole process lets me confirm if my original text has remained unchanged. It's a practical way for me to ensure the integrity of my data, catching even the smallest alterations.<br>
